// Assignment question
/*write a program to fing LCM of two number.*/
/*Therefore, the formula to find LCM of two numbers is, LCM of two numbers = product 
of two numbers รท HCF of two numbers. Note: The LCM of two co-prime numbers is equal to
the product of co-prime numbers because the highest common factor of prime numbers is
1.*/
